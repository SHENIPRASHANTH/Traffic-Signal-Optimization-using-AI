# Traffic-Signal-Optimization-using-AI
This project dynamically allocates traffic signal timings based on real-time vehicle count using a YOLOv5-based object detection model. The system adjusts signal duration to optimize traffic flow, reducing congestion and improving emergency vehicle response times.
