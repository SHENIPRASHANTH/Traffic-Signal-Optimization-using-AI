# Traffic-Signal-Optimization-using-AI
This project dynamically allocates traffic signal timings based on real-time vehicle count using a YOLOv5-based object detection model. The system adjusts signal duration to optimize traffic flow, reducing congestion and improving emergency vehicle response times.

Setup
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/reyy/Traffic-SIH.git
cd Traffic-SIH/smart

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
